MADebugTools
============

A set of unusual categories that every iOS developer needs in his dev and testing toolkit.

So far just one category is included, the ability to display the class name of every UIViewController, useful for debugging retro-code and figuring out what class is responsible for what.

Usage:

- Drop UIView+MADebugTools.h/m into your Project
- Build + GO!
